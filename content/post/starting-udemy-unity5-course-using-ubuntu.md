I know I'm not the only one who does this.  But here is where I publicly admit how I can't remember how many times I've "started getting into game development."  I've partially completed guides and books for Phaser, Godot, Unity3D but only so far back as XNA.  Then I get sidetracked by life or how little I was contributing compared to others on my team.

How do I make sure I stick to it this time?  Easy.  Do like I do and overcomplicate things by trying to do them the most amazing way possible: ON LINUX.

There's actually some amazing gamedev tools you can use on Linux these days.

* You can request permission to [build the Unreal Linux Client from source](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Building_On_Linux), which is 2x as awesome and grueling as you'd think.

* [Godot](http://www.godotengine.org/projects/godot-engine) is an open source engine with Python-like scripting.  No royalties is a nice bonus, and will likely tempt me to give it an honest shot in the future.  Development and community have been qutie active since it was released under MIT license years ago.

* [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) is no stranger to Linux-compatible gamedev.  HTML5 and Javascript have proven quite popular for gamedev based on a popular web stack.  Look out for [Phaser3 a.k.a. Lazer](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3) in the coming months.

All of these play nicely enough with other open source or otherwise Linux-friendly tools like [Blender](http://www.blender.org/), [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/), [Krita](https://krita.org/), and [Audacity](http://audacityteam.org/).  There are many other more specialized tools out there, but I'm already getting out of control.

So, why use the one game engine that's later to the Linux-support-game than all the others?  The people I'd most likely build a game with are set on Unity on Windows, and I wanted to see how well collaborating on the same project with the experimental Linux client would go.
