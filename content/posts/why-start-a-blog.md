## Why indeed

I'm familiar with some common reasons for maintaining a blog or personal website. Some seem selfish, some altruistic. Some of them seem relatable, to an extent.

<!--more-->

* Catalog and share lessons you've learned.
* Share work that's difficult to capture in a resume.
* Influence people and rake in ad revenue... ok maybe not.

Now, I'm not suggesting it's impossible to build a blog for selfless reasons. I'm just not going to kid myself or anyone that might stumble accross this. Building and writing on a personal website is inherently self-focused, so I figure I should at least reflect on and share *my* reasons.

## It's a time capsule
It feels a bit like an accountability partner, like one might seek when setting learning or fitness goals.

I'd like to be able to scroll back to a post or project 2 years from now, and reflect on the delta. Sharing your goals, progress achieved, or reasons for abandoning them *out in the open* can be terrifying. But sometimes that terror can bring clarity.

In that spirit, when I re-rolled this blog, I realized my previous attempt had a single post from 2015 ... about how to host a blog using GitHub pages. It was quaint, eye-rollingly meta, and self entertaining. That's fine. But that's also where it ended.

## It's liberating
I don't need to circle back and check how many likes or reactions a post has garnered. I don't need to stress about how *The Algorithm* will treat my post in my friends' feeds.

I have something for which I want to organize my thoughts, or progress on a project I'd like to record, so I write about it. Done.

## It's necessary
I'm not in a region that's ... known for its competitive tech job market. Heck, even major aerospace engineering opportunities have been exported over the last decade or so.

So I figure that for the sake of my current or future employment, I need to show extra effort. If I'm going to strive or claim adaptability or resilience, I'll need to prove it.

## It's the Internet
I'm pretty sure there's some "middle aged suburbanite in tech" Bingo card I just helped someone fill. Happy to oblige!

## It's for me
As someone who strives to be who they are in public just as they'd be in private, all the better if I write it here.

As someone who receives gentle feedback on occasion that sometimes my emails are very ... thorough, I look forward to sharing in a place where "thorough" or "longform" is less surprising.

## It's long overdue
For better or worse, my ... situation (way before COVID-19) had sent me on a mission to check off or remove ooooold things from my backburner. In the same stride I also took a hard look at what I spent my time on. Were they important? If so, is it *also* something I need to keep doing? Could someone else do a better job?

I've returned to some constructive hobbies that I'm lucky enough to share with my kids. I've admitted I was spread too thin, so I let my volunteers step up and own the gamejam I started years ago. I finished a long-abandoned project I used to learn new tech. It's not that great. But I finished it, so now I can reflect on its rough edges with fresh eyes.

I'd hate to invoke Murphy's Law by promising this time will be different than 2015, so I won't. But I need to start somewhere, even if it's just to tee myself up for an extra-meta post in 2025.
