# I am Jim Rice

## Profesionally...

I've served as QA, Performance Test Engineer, Front-end Developer, Test Automation Engineer, and Scrum Master. Currently, I'm a Product Owner, but I'd like to return to my roots and build.

## Personally...

I'm picking up the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/). I have served as a moderator for our [local dev group](https://devict.org/), and started their twice-yearly [gamejam event](http://ictgamejam.com/) in 2015. My oldest kids have asked me to help them learn how to make video games. Wish me luck!

When I need a break from screens, I'm usually building or flying a model airplane, or (hopefully) running at the local park. Occasionally I'll mull over what to do with my backlog of hobby electronics supplies.

## Thanks...

It's good of you to drop by. Please feel free to reach out and share what *you* are working on via any of my linked social accounts, or directly via `hitjim` at `<ubiquitous email starting in 'g'>`.
