I work at NetApp in Wichita KS as a Javascript developer.  We're building an AngularJS UI for enterprise block storage systems.

I'm passionate about building and learning.  In particular I enjoy using Linux and FOSS tools whenever possible.  However, I usually enjoy learning a new toolset or OS, as long as it's an empowering experience.  Sussing out the strengths and weakness of a platform is part of the adventure!

Lately I'm digging into game development.  I'm most tempted by [Unity3D](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/08/26/unity-comes-to-linux-experimental-build-now-available/), [Godot](http://www.godotengine.org/projects/godot-engine), and [PhaserJS](http://phaser.io/).  Distribution on multiple platforms will always be a goal.  I founded the [ICTGameJam](http://ictgamejam.com), and love coordinating and encouraging local game development events.

I'm also enjoying my new foray into Go.  Maybe it's the strong typing making me nostalgic for the C I used in college... or maybe it's the charming mascot.

You might occasionally see what I'm up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/hitjim).  But sometimes you won't... for *secret reasons.*

I usually illustrate at least one t-shirt per year, and plan the odd electronics project.  I love plugging and supporting our local makerspace [MakeICT](http://makeict.org), and participating in our local programming enthusiast group [devICT](http://devict.org).
