# I am Jim Rice

## Profesionally...

I've served as QA, Performance Test Engineer, Front-end Developer, Test Automation Engineer, and Scrum Master. Currently, I'm a Product Owner, but I'd like to return to my roots and build.

So far all this experience has been under NetApp. I got my start on their [E-Series SAN products](https://www.netapp.com/us/documentation/eseries-santricity.aspx), a tech "best kept secret" in an aerospace-heavy region. In recent years I've been focused on their SolidFire scale-out [storage](https://www.netapp.com/us/products/storage-systems/all-flash-array/solidfire-scale-out.aspx) and [HCI](https://www.netapp.com/us/products/converged-systems/hyper-converged-infrastructure.aspx) products.

## Personally...

I'm picking up the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/). I have served as a moderator for our [local dev group](https://devict.org/), and started their twice-yearly [gamejam event](http://ictgamejam.com/) in 2015. My oldest kids have asked me to help them learn how to make video games. Wish me luck!

When I need a break from screens, I'm usually building or flying a model airplane, or (hopefully) running at the local park. Occasionally I'll mull over what to do with my backlog of hobby electronics supplies.

## Thanks...
